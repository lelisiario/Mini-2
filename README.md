I created this at the end of week 2 during my boot camp! 
I built this project as means of mastering HTML and CSS. It was really fun to work with gradients! 
This webpage serves as a CSS cheatsheet for future reference. Plus it looks really cool!
I learned how to attatch CSS stylesheets to the HTML page. I also learned how to make something that looks cool!
